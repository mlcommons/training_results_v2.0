# This package tests the behavior of closure_js_deps. This package also tests
# the behavior runfiles with regard to closure_js_library, closure_js_binary,
# and closure_js_deps.
#
# The concepts of deps files and runfiles are intertwined. If one wishes to
# develop in raw sources mode, one needs a deps file. In order for a deps file
# to be useful, one must also assemble and serve the runfiles data=[...] it
# references.
#
# Filegroups should not needed to assemble the raw sources, because the closure
# rules themselves can behave like smart filegroups. The tests in this package
# demonstrate how the sources and data files propagate through them.
#
# tl;dr: java_binary() data attribute only needs to reference the deps rule.
